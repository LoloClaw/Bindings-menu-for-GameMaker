This is a github repository for my simple rebinding system for GamaMaker
It contains the example project in the itch page: [Simple rebinding system](https://lolo-claw.itch.io/easy-rebinding-system)

If you just want the functions in a .yymps file go to the itch page

This is a system for rebinding keys for gamepads, mouse and keyboard.
It includes both the bindings system and my menu system. The menu system is used in the bindings system and is made to be really easy to use with it.
This is meant to be a very simple way to do bindings, with no external non-gamemaker skills requiered to use and understand but it's not comprehensive. 
If you want a full rebinding system that supports all gamepads I suggest using the Input library.

You don't have to credit me if you use this in a game but I'd appreaciate it if you do!
Here is a features list:
- pre-made rebinding menu with built-in icons
- simple menu system compatible withy the bindings one
- easy set-up
- check for mouse scrolls or controller sticks as if they were buttons
- drawing keys for easy tutorials
- very commented code for easy modifications
- save the rebindings automatically
- customizable fonts and sizes

cons:
- only playstation icons supported for gamepads
- loading older bindings eats newer ones
- can't assign 2 bindings to the same device
